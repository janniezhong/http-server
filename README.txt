Description:

Part 1: A webpage that displays 3 lines of text and 2 images. Anyone else excited for the TOG anime?

Part 2: An http web server that, when run, can display files in my html directory and access an mdb-lookup-server running on a different port. Both parts should work fine, with the exception of a small amount of memory still reachable at the end of the http server if Ctrl-C is used to exit the program.
